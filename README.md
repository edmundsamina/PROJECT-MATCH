# Project Match

For our project this week, we had to create an application that would enhance the experience 
or solve a problem a bootcamper on a coding bootcamp might face.  

From our discussion, which we used to create our user personas, 
we found the common problem that we have all found. As we are all new to the tech industry,
it can be overwhelming to try work on projects independently. Our platform would be a social environment 
to enable people to connect and collaborate on projects together.

This is our MVP, so all you can do is search for projects by stack, and also post a project.
